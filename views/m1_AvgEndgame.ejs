        <p> 
          After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins due to the efforts of the Mad Titan, Thanos. With the help of remaining allies, 
          the Avengers must assemble once more in order to undo Thanos's actions and undo the chaos to the universe, no matter what consequences may be in store, and no matter who they face...

          "I loved the movie a lot 
          As I am great fan of marvel Avengers: Endgame', which marks the end of the Infinity Saga, is spellbounding and surely an enthralling experience. 
          The last film of the 'Avengers' franchise is remarkable and doesn't disappoint. Watching all our favourite superheroes in one film is just surpassing. Marvel has been working on this grand culmination ever since they released 'Iron Man'. 
          I'm damn sure that all of their hard work and ambition has paid off...."

          "The entire mcu timeline consisting of 22 movies led up to this once-in-a-lifetime event. Avengers Endgame blew me away, as I am a huge fan of the marvel franchise. If you thought that Infinity War 
           was the one to watch, you'll think differently after watching Endgame.
        </p>

          "Avengers endgame is hands down the best superhero film ever made. Yes, I enjoyed endgame more than Infinity war, Into the spider verse, Batman Begins, and Dark knight rises. Even though movies like Infinity 
          war had more action and more battles between the heroes and the villains, endgame gives just enough action for the movie to not feel boring but also doesn't overload you with endless action sequences without focusing 
          on a coherent story. It was the perfect follow up to the events at the end of Infinity war where for the first time the heroes do not win. While I find the concept of time travel and parallel universes presented within endgame to be 
          complicated and a bit confusing at times, (and yes I know that according to the comics that infinity stones only work within their own dimension, and thus taking an infinity stone from one universe will not make it work in another universe)..
