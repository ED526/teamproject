        <h3> <strong> Summary </strong> </h3>

        <p> 
          During World War I, two British soldiers -- Lance Cpl. Schofield and Lance Cpl. Blake -- receive seemingly impossible orders. In a race against time, they must cross over into enemy territory to deliver a message that could potentially 
          save 1,600 of their fellow comrades -- including Blake's own brother.

          I am pretty late to reviewing 1917, I saw it as soon as it came out in theatres and by God is this a cinematic experience! If you didn't see this movie in the cinema, what were you doing? I mean seriously! 
          What were you wasting your time on, because this movie is amazing! I've seen many great films this decade, don't get me wrong, but 1917 has to be one of the best! The atmosphere and the cinematography of this movie makes you feel like you're part of the war, 
          Roger Deakins is easily the greatest cinematographer working today and that is just a straight fact. At times, it can get a bit overwhelming, I must admit. There were many times during the film where I would burst into tears!

          "It's a stunning watch from start to finish. The amount of work that went into this film alone deserves your attendance, and even then, the story never stalls, and has a fair balance between war and humanity, 
          and has some of the most incredible camera work I've seen in a while. It's hands down my favorite film of 2019.

          "Filmed and edited as if it was one long take, the camera never leaves our main protagonists, Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman) and Schofield (George MacKay), out of its sight. Mendes (Skyfall) and co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns (Penny Dreadful) therefore corner 
          themselves by relying on this kind of linear storytelling, to tell a very focused but at times a somewhat thin tale. Some of the scenes are so empty, it will for sure test audiences' patience. Technical, '1917' is a true feast for the eyes and ears.

          1917 is without a doubt a technical masterpiece, that will inspire many filmmakers, but I can't feel a bit let down. As an overall film, it wants to play a heavy tune on your heartstrings, but can't reach that level of sentiment, because the focus on technicalities pulled me out of the story. 
          It for sure is one of the better films 2019 has brought to the big screen, yet a bit more focus on the script could've made this the cinematic masterpiece of the decade. Nonetheless, I recommend watching this on the biggest screen possible and enjoy another fine piece of cinema brought to you by Sam Mendes."
